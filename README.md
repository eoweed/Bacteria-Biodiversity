# Bacteria-Biodiversity


### Overview: 
###### The purpose of this project is to create a webpage to visualize the types of bacteria found in the belly buttons of volunteer subjects. 
###### The webpage contains a dropdown menu to select the volunteer ID number and displays a table of metadata and three charts. A gauge chart displays the washing habits of the volunteer. The other two charts show the different types of bacteria and the number of bacteria cultures found for the selected volunteer.
