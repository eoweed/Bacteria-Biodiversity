# Bacteria-Biodiversity
Study of bacteria that synthesizes proteins which taste like beef.


### Overview: The purpose of this project is to create a webpage to visualize the types of bacteria found in the belly buttons of volunteers. The webpage displays a table of the volunteer's metadata, based on ID number to remain anonymous. A gauge chart displays the washing habits of the volunteer. A bar chart and a bubble chart show the different types of bacteria and the number of bacteria cultures found for the selected volunteer.
